Continuous-Kalman-Filter-Lib
============================

A simulink example of the continuous time Kalman filter.

Modify the A, Bu, Bw, C, D matrices, and play with the noise to see the effect of the Kalman filter.

Feel free to use this Simulink Model to teach or learn more about the Kalman Filter.
Requires:
* Matlab
* Simulink
* Control System Toolbox (recommended for analysis and further understanding)
